            <h2> About me </h2>
            <p> I bridge the vap between vision and reality through the power of code. </p>
            <p> I'm an ambitious up-and-coming full-stack web developer with a deep passion, big plans, and with bigger dreams in computer science. 
                I have a solid grasp of web design and frontend development with experience in video editing, creative writing, vector illustration and game modding as well. 
            </p>
            <p> I am interested in learning more about UI/UX design, becoming a better and more engaging website designer and getting my foot in the door with backend web 
                development. I will complete my associate's in Computer Information Systems and move to a bachelor's degree in either Computer Science or Information Systems, 
                hopefully either at John Jay or CCNY &mdash;with a minor in math because I'm terrible at math!

                        alt="A picture of me"
                        align="right"
                        height="200px" />
                </figure>
            </p>

            <h3> Project schedule </h3>
            <p> I'm currently working on my portfolio and a small e-commerce website for a local small fashion business. And with the advent of the computer programming club, I'll also
                be helping contribute to building a fresh and clean design with other students. 
            </p>
            <p> Afterwards I'll be moving onto recreating BMCC's <a href="https://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/news/map-quest/"> MapQuest</a> feature into a fresh re-imagained revival with all of
                the functionality one would expect and need in a college campus map. When I first came here to BMCC, it was hard to navigate and it was such a surprise to see this deprecated.
                I will be working with my GIS professor on this task and possibly other students depending on the scope and scale of the project.

                        height="200px" />
                    <figcaption> BMCC's old MapQuest app which is now a 404 for reasons unknown. </figcaption>

            </p>

            <p> On the side I am hoping to quickly put together a small issue I had when registering for classes with the introduction of "CUNYFirst Import Schedule". Which will
                be a small web application that scans your schedule builder's .pdf and create a .ics file for easy Google Calendar integration while also returning each professor's 
                rating from the famous <a link="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com"> rate my professors </a> website. This tool would be open-source and public for use which will
                vastly improve the student experience with scheduling classes in the CUNY system. After that, aside from building a few passion projects I have in mind, I hope to
                expand a bit and build websites for local charitable organizations and pitch to student clubs that could benefit from a (revamped) website.
            </p>

            <h3> Outside of Programming </h3>
            <p> I have been writing a fiction book for the past four years on & off for fun, I plan to write a trilogy over the next decade and hopefully build it on from there. 
                I'm also looking to enter internships and other student opportunities. I am currently in the process of volunteering for local organizations like RiseBoro and 
                GreenNYC. I love cooking, running, reading and gonna try to get my foot in the door with woodworking as well!
            </p>

            <p> I plan to finish learning French to get my certificate of language proficiency soon but it is honestly just a matter of making study time. I am also interested 
                in trying cybersecurity in the long-run as possibly a side endeavor or as a professional. I'm hoping to get into the <a href="https://clscholarship.org/"> critical 
                language scholarship </a> for either Chinese, Russian or Portuguese in a future summer depending on availability. </p>

                that is in active development. And is made to complete an assignment. I've had little time to make this websiter responsive or fix any gaps in my design/CSS.
                Also: none of my projects are published yet, so all links in the work-experience section are purely for style. This will be revised later on but for now, while
                the information in this website is factual&mdash;the project links are purely mockup.
